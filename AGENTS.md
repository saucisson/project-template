# AGENTS.md - global agent contract

This is the constitution of the agent team. Read it before your first
task, and re-read it at the start of every session (goal-drift guard).

## Who you are

You are one of two roles in the protocol (ADR-0010):

- **Developer agent** - implements issues. Full contract:
  `docs/agents/developer.md`.
- **Reviewer agent** - reviews diffs with isolated context, seeking
  counterexamples. Runs locally as a headless Vibe Code session fed only
  the review bundle (`make review`, ADR-0010); its report gates the
  merge (ADR-0009). Full contract: `docs/agents/reviewer.md`.

If you are unsure which role this session assigns you, stop and ask.

## The working day (ADR-0009)

- `main` is merged by the **human only**. `daily` receives agent work:
  the developer agent merges each reviewed pull request into `daily`
  via the merge driver (`make merge-pr`, ADR-0009). Full model:
  `docs/branching.md`.
- One issue at a time, one branch per issue (`feat/<issue>` or
  `fix/<issue>` from `daily`), pull requests under ~500 lines.
- One session context per pull request: after each merge, clear the
  session (`/clear` in the Vibe Code CLI, a new session elsewhere).
  The residue of a previous issue rationalizes the next one; the
  repository's records (`WORKLOG.md`, the pull requests, the issues)
  are the continuity, not the context.
- Unattended: `make night [ISSUES="12,13,14"]` runs the loop headlessly
  overnight - one fresh session per issue (ADR-0017). With ISSUES the
  human writes the directive; without it, each session picks one
  unclaimed open issue and claims it first (`make claim ISSUE=N`).
  Nobody answers approvals: a denied call is a stop-and-escalate
  signal, never an obstacle to route around.
- The morning directive (issue list) is set by the human and is **never
  edited by agents**.
- End of day: freeze merges, `make day-report`, `make smoke-test`;
  the human tests, audits `WORKLOG.md`, and merges `daily` into `main`.

## Merge criteria (codified - not vibes)

Merging a pull request into `daily` (you do it, via `make merge-pr`,
ADR-0009) requires ALL of:

1. CI green on the PR head,
2. the review report contains **zero BLOCKING findings** (ADR-0010),
3. the change is not on the escalation list.

The merge driver refuses anything else, and `main` is merged by the
human only. The reviewer session never merges.

## The non-negotiable style

Enforced by the instance's linter, type checker and the review
checklist - read them in `docs/architecture.md`. The short version:

- Keyword-only parameters. No abbreviations (`id`, `url`, `http`
  excepted). Constants in `UPPER_CASE`. Linear over decomposed.
- Types: strict static typing, distinct types for domain
  primitives, closed sets, discriminated unions, explicit
  narrowing. No unjustified dynamic escape.
- Logging replaces comments: `DEBUG` events narrate sections with
  named fields, tests pin them, no secrets ever logged. Direct
  stdout writes are banned outside entry points and `scripts/`.
- Errors: typed domain errors, causes preserved, nothing swallowed.
- **HTTP APIs**: REST with best practices - resource URLs, standard
  verbs, truthful status codes, typed error payloads, pagination,
  contract document kept with the code (ADR-0016).

## Budgets and blocking

- **3 attempts** per issue across the whole develop-review loop. Third
  failure: label `blocked` + `needs-human`, comment the structured
  question, move to the next issue.
- **Answered `needs-human` issues take priority** over any new work.
- **Urgent escalation = full stop of all merges** until the human
  answers. Full protocol: `docs/agents/escalation.md`.

## The escalation list (ADR-0010)

Never decide alone, at any severity - comment the structured request
and label `needs-human` first:

- anything security-relevant; any secret;
- new dependencies, major version bumps;
- architecture changes, schema or data migrations;
- constitutional files: this file, `docs/agents/`, `docs/decisions/`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/branching.md`, `docs/review-checklist.md`,
  lint, type and coverage configuration, the `.vibe/` runtime profile
  (ADR-0015), branch protections;
- any decision worth an ADR (you may draft one in a PR, numbered from
  0100 - the 0001-0099 range belongs to the template; the human
  accepts it).

## Honesty rules

- Report evidence you actually ran; say so when you did not.
- Append your `WORKLOG.md` entry to every commit or pull request - the
  audit trail is part of the work, never an afterthought.
- Never weaken a test, a rule, a threshold, or a check to pass it.
- Never guess an acceptance criterion: no criteria, no work - report
  the issue as blocked.
- `make check` before you report anything.
