# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records **why** a choice was made, so it can be revisited later with
the original reasoning in hand - not to freeze it.

## Process (MADR-lite)

Each ADR is one file, `adr-NNNN-short-name.md`, containing:

- **Status**: `accepted` (or `superseded by adr-NNNN`).
- **Date**: the decision date.
- **Context**: the forces at play.
- **Options considered**: with explicit trade-offs, including the rejected
  ones and why.
- **Decision**: the chosen option.
- **Consequences**: including the negatives - every decision has some.

## Rules

- Accepted ADRs are **never edited**. A reversal is a new ADR that
  references and supersedes the old one. Two owner-set exceptions are
  recorded here: stale driver path references (ADR-0021) follow the
  code so projects instantiated from the template never inherit dead
  paths, and the pull request size budget referenced by ADR-0019 was
  raised from ~500 to ~1000 changed lines by owner instruction
  (2026-11-09) so the ADR text follows the threshold the review gate
  actually applies. Apart from these, the decisions themselves never
  change.
- Superseded ADRs are removed from the repository; ADR numbers are
  never reused.
- **Numbering**: ADR numbers `0001`-`0099` are reserved for the
  template's own decisions (currently 0001-0021). A project
  instantiated from this template numbers its own, project-specific
  ADRs from `0100` upward, so a template update can add new template
  ADRs without ever colliding with the project's.
- ADRs are constitutional files: agents may **draft** a new ADR inside
  a pull request, but only the human owner accepts it. Draft status is
  explicit at the top of the file.
- "ADR-worthy" changes are on the strict escalation list
  (`docs/agents/escalation.md`).
- The ADRs are **language- and tool-agnostic**: they record the ideas.
  The concrete tools of an instance (its language, linter, type
  checker, test runner) apply the ideas; the template's own Python
  tools are the worked example.
